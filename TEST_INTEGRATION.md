## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start?
1. Check MongoDB is running
2. Verify all dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Check for syntax errors in new files

### Endpoints return 404?
1. Verify routes are registered in app.js
2. Check route paths match exactly
3. Restart server

### Authentication errors?
1. Verify JWT token is valid
2. Check Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`
3. Ensure user exists in database

### Module not found errors?
1. Check file paths in require statements
2. Verify all controller files exist
3. Check middleware import paths

## 📊 Expected Server Output

When server starts successfully:
```
Server running on port 4000
Environment: development
Socket.io initialized for real-time notifications
Scheduled tasks initialized for earnings reset
MongoDB Connected: localhost
Creating geospatial indexes...
✓ Created index for origin.coordinates
✓ Created index for destination.coordinates
✓ Created index for status and type
✓ Created index for driver currentLocation
✓ Created index for driver role and online status
All indexes created successfully!

## ✅ Success Indicators

Your integration is successful if:
1. ✅ Server starts without errors
2. ✅ All routes are registered
3. ✅ Endpoints respond (even if with auth errors)
4. ✅ No "module not found" errors
5. ✅ MongoDB connects successfully

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Test all endpoints** using Postman or curl
2. **Create test promo codes** via admin endpoint
3. **Complete a test ride** and submit rating
4. **Generate referral code** for testing
5. **Check ride history** works correctly

Now that backend is integrated, you can:
1. Create rating screen in Flutter
2. Add fare estimation to booking flow
3. Implement promo code screen
4. Add SOS button to active ride
5. Build ride history screen
