# Driver Functionality Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive driver functionality implemented for the WiseRide application.

## Overview

The driver functionality provides a complete solution for drivers to manage their rides, track earnings, and interact with the ride-sharing system. The implementation includes both backend API endpoints and mobile app screens.

## Backend Implementation

### Enhanced User Model

The User model has been enhanced with driver-specific fields:

```javascript
// New driver-specific fields added to User model
driverLicense: String,
vehicleInfo: {
  make: String,
  model: String,
  year: Number,
  color: String,
  plateNumber: String,
  capacity: Number
},
isOnline: Boolean,
currentLocation: {
  lat: Number,
  lng: Number,
  address: String,
  timestamp: Date
},
earnings: {
  total: Number,
  today: Number,
  thisWeek: Number,
  thisMonth: Number
},
rating: {
  average: Number,
  count: Number
}
```

### Driver Controller

New controller (`backend/controllers/driverController.js`) with the following endpoints:

- `PUT /api/driver/location` - Update driver location
- `PUT /api/driver/toggle-online` - Toggle online/offline status
- `GET /api/driver/rides/nearby` - Get nearby available rides
- `PUT /api/driver/rides/:rideId/accept` - Accept a ride
- `PUT /api/driver/rides/:rideId/start` - Start a ride
- `PUT /api/driver/rides/:rideId/complete` - Complete a ride
- `GET /api/driver/earnings` - Get driver earnings
- `PUT /api/driver/profile` - Update driver profile
- `GET /api/driver/dashboard` - Get dashboard data

### API Routes

New route file (`backend/routes/driverRoutes.js`) that handles all driver-specific endpoints with proper authentication middleware.

## Mobile App Implementation

3. **Available Rides Screen** (`available_rides_screen.dart`)
   - List of nearby available rides
   - Filter by vehicle type (taxi, bus, minibus)
   - Ride cards with rider information and route details

## Usage Flow

### Driver Registration and Setup
1. Driver registers with basic information
2. Completes driver profile with license and vehicle details
3. Admin verifies driver information
4. Driver can start accepting rides

### Daily Driver Workflow
1. Driver goes online in the app
2. Receives notifications for nearby ride requests
3. Views available rides and accepts suitable ones
4. Navigates to pickup location
5. Starts ride and tracks to destination
6. Completes ride and receives payment
7. Views earnings and ride history

### Ride Lifecycle
1. **Requested** - Rider requests a ride
2. **Accepted** - Driver accepts the ride
3. **In Progress** - Driver starts the ride
4. **Completed** - Driver completes the ride

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
